# Green Lattice Overlay for r/place



## Step 1

Install one of the following extensions for your browser.

[Chrome (TamperMonkey)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

[Firefox (ViolentMonkey)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) (note: TamperMonkey __will not__ work, you have to use ViolentMonkey.)

## Step 2

Install the Userscript:

[lattice.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcb1032/greenlattice-place/main/lattice.user.js)

#

### Mobile

Sorry, the script is unavailable for mobile users.

### Updates

The overlay will be automatically updated by our team, and you shouldn't have to change anything.

However, sometimes your browser will cache the overlay image for faster loading times. You can go to [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcb1032/greenlattice-place/main/lattice_overlay.png) and click the refresh button (F5) while holding shift to re-cache the image.

### Contributing

1. Open `lattice_full.png` in photoshop, make changes, and save over the original, with the same name
2. Run the `dithering.py` script* in the same folder as the saved `lattice_full.png` image
3. Upload `lattice_full.png` and the newly generated `lattice_overlay.png` to github

*\*You will need to install Pillow and NumPY for the script to work.*
`py -m pip install NumPy>=1.22`
`py -m pip install Pillow>=9.0`
